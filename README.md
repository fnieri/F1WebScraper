The aim of this project is to scrape data from a given F1 year Wikipedia Page and get the stats from said year.
I'm doing this project for a friends' Stats Course and for fun, if you see any bugs, please report them.
Stats that can be scraped.
Pole - win mean.	
Retirements per year
Disqualifications per year
